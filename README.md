### Decision Tree Learning – From Theory to Practice
This repository contains code notes and experiments based on my learning journey through decision trees, following a machine learning book. The goal is to understand how decision trees work in practice — from training and prediction to advanced topics like regularization and regression.

### Training and Visualizing Decision Trees
- Fit a decision tree to a dataset
- Plot and interpret the tree structure
- Use the tree to make predictions

### Understanding the CART Algorithm
- How the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm works
- How splits are chosen (Gini impurity, entropy)
- Step-by-step breakdown of training

### Regularizing Decision Trees
- Preventing overfitting with hyperparameters like:
- max_depth
- min_samples_split
- min_samples_leaf

### Decision Trees for Regression
- Using trees to predict continuous values
- Visualizing regression trees
- Evaluating performance

### Limitations of Decision Trees
- Overfitting and high variance
- Lack of smooth predictions
- Sensitivity to data variations
